## About / Recommendations

Teams of web evaluators whose members have varying levels of skill regarding the topic of the checklist, can nonetheless certify standards at an appropriate and precise level of specificity. Clicking the checkbox on a failed item helps generate a to-do list of likewise-specific resources for fixing, when pages need to be turned back to the editor for more work.

If the guidelines were stored in a database, this type of checklist would be easy to create and maintain, and there would be fewer accessibility consequences. You could also track top problems and make it a priority to improve those solutions. Database columns to serve out this information might include:

- Numbered guideline, as a yes/no question to be answered.
- Short &quot;how-to&quot; or &quot;why&quot; statements, when appropriate. This makes for more concise guideline statements. Instructions for proper conduct of the test and  how to know when the criterion is satisfied.
- Pass/Fail decision item (here, a checkbox).
- Answer text as an imperative - You have this specific problem; here's how to solve it.
- Resource URL - where to go for more information; this single link would appear near the evaluation guideline AND near the answer text, and would help the user to learn more about the topic in a non-threatening way (such as one stand-alone web page on the host site per guideline).
- &lt;noscript&gt;  content when the checklist user has JavaScript turned off.
