# Checklist-based web site evaluation

Try this checklist if you're intestested in prototyping how web content review might be supported like two sides of a coin: (1) How/what to test, and (2) How to fix if needed. Would checklists like this one be useful in continuous web optimization?

## About / Recommendations

Checklists like this one could be used by teams of web evaluators, to certify standards have been followed at a precise level of specificity for all reviewers no matter their expertise, and to generate to-do lists when pages need to be turned back to the editor for more work.

If the guidelines were stored in a database, this type of checklist would be easy to create and maintain, and there would be fewer accessibility consequences. You could also track top problems and make it a priority to improve those solutions. Database columns to serve out this information might include:

- Numbered guideline, as a yes/no question to be answered.
- Short &quot;how-to&quot; or &quot;why&quot; statements, when appropriate. This makes for more concise guideline statements. Instructions for proper conduct of the test and  how to know when the criterion is satisfied.
- Pass/Fail decision item (here, a checkbox).
- Answer text as an imperative - You have this specific problem; here's how to solve it.
- Resource URL - where to go for more information; this single link would appear near the evaluation guideline AND near the answer text, and would help the user to learn more about the topic in a non-threatening way (such as one stand-alone web page on the host site per guideline).
- &lt;noscript&gt;  content when the checklist user has JavaScript turned off.

More content could be added in most of the categories. The full system would also have a dedicated page on the web that is specially fitted to each guideline - one helpful web page with how-to summary and links/resources.
